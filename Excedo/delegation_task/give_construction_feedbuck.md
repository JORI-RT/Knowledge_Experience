How do you feel the task went?
what do you feel went well?
what didn't go so well?
## follow up question
Why weren't you able to complete the task on time?
Did you change your approach when that happened
how did you manage to complete it on time

## Give feedback

### review what went well
You did a really good job of managing your time
The results were very impressive
I liked the way you presented the report
I can see that you put a lot of thought into the design.

### review what didn't go well
it was a mistake not to add time for research to the schedule.
I think we needed to communicate more about the schedule
The problem was that the work didn't follow the brief

## Make recommendation
### connect actions to result
Because you followed the brief, the client was happy
Thanks to your research, you were able to answer all the question
We needed to prepare more thoroughly, as a result , we weren't able to answer question
We didU't communication with the client enough, and so they were unhappy with some of our ideas
### suggest improvement
How about making a more detailed plan next time?
Next time, let's communicate more in writing
it would be a good idea to comunicate with the client more regularly


My boss thought actor choice was good
Too long almost 3 minutes
Music is too traditional , doesn't reflectd our brancd
music -> traditional, doesn't represent our brand

Because you didn't prepare the promotional video as requested , we will need more time to edit it.

How about following the request next time?
