## structure meeting
### present task
First of all today , we are gogin to discuss any task which are under review.
Then, we'll go through the in-progress tasks and get updates on those.
Following that, we'll look at all upcoming tasks for the next 2 week.
Does anyone have any questions or have I missed anythins?
### Discuss additional task
There is a card on the to-do-list about the alternative pricing model.Would it be possible to discuss that?
Will we get a chance to talk about kicking off the new calorie counter feature?we didn't cover that in our last call.
It is on our to-do list but it's not the fightest priority and i can wait untill our next planning meeting
I'm going to add htis task to the to-do list and let's aim to complete it during the next 2 weeks.

## encourage contribution
### ask about task status and detail update
Gloria, I can see you have completed two of three sub-task on this card.
How far have you got with the remaining task?
Magda, you updated this card yesterday.
Can you tell us more about the status of this task?
Ramon, you are leading on this task.
Has there been any progress about the status of the task?

### talking about update
That card can be marked as complete as I contacted the agencies, reviewed the prices and samples and I've now booked the editor.
This task is nearly there but let's keep it open bacause there's an issue and we're slightly behind schedule.
I think this task is needs more discussion.
I'll move it back to the in-progress column.

## generate commitment
### assign 
Romman, I know you are busy at the moment.  but could you take this task on as well?
Gloria, this is your area of expertise. Would you be able to work on this next week?
Magda, can I assign this task to you or can somebody else take it?
### confirm
Sorry, but I won't be able to commit to that because I'm overseeing the video edits.
Can you clarify what I need to deliver by the 30th.
I can take this task but we need to extend the deadline.
